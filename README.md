# Emergency Medical System – Java Implementation
# Description:

This project is a Java-based Emergency Medical System for tracking emergency medical services. The system manages doctors, patients, medical diagnoses, and procedures. It allows doctors to log in, create and update patient records, search for diagnoses, and generate reports, which can be exported as PDFs.

# Key features:

1. User authentication for secure doctor logins.

2. Patient management (create, search, update).

3. Diagnosis and procedure handling using Serbian healthcare standards (MKB-10).

4. Report generation with PDF export.

5. Excel file import for bulk medical data entry.

6. Unit testing to ensure software reliability.

# Techniques Used:

1. Java Authentication for secure doctor logins.

2. JXL Library for importing Excel-based diagnosis and procedure data.

3. iText PDF for generating medical reports in PDF format.

4. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) for interacting with the medical database.

5. Unit Testing with JUnit to ensure code reliability.

# Technologies and Libraries:

1. Java SE – Core programming language for the application.

2. JXL (Java Excel API) – Reads and writes Excel files for managing diagnosis and procedure data.

3. iText PDF – Generates PDF reports.

4. JUnit – Used for unit testing.

5. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) – For database interactions.
